OpenVPN can also run in bridge mode (layer 2 VPN).
Most of the time the routed mode of OpenVPN (layer 3 VPN) is preferable.
Bridging always seems to be very attractive - until more than 10
devices participate. For debugging purposes only bridging is often very
handy. For that in this container there is a prepared configuration

Howto start OpenVPN-Bridge to act as an OpenVPN server:
- Configure net interface to act as the one to listen for the OpenVPN clients
- Configure eth1 as the common bridge network
- Edit /etc/inittab and enable the server
- Edit /etc/openvpn/server.ovpn and modify IP address pool for clients
- Restart container

Howto start OpenVPN-Bridge to act as an OpenVPN client:
- Configure net interface to act as the one to connect the OpenVPN
- Configure eth1 as the common bridge network
- Edit /etc/inittab and enable the client
- Edit /etc/openvpn/client.ovpn and modify IP address of remote server
- Restart container

A demo setup:
=============
The routers net1 is used as the "WAN".
The routers net2 is used as the "LAN" that should be bridge to the other routers net2.

The router acting as a OpenVPN server:
--------------------------------------
    net1: 192.168.1.1/24
    net2: 192.168.7.1/24

Container net-tools:
    first net interface:
        - bridge to net1
        - IP: 192.168.1.5/24
    second net interface:
        - bridge to net2
        - IP: 192.168.7.2/24

The router acting as a OpenVPN client:
--------------------------------------
    net1: 192.168.1.1/24
    net2: 192.168.7.4/24

Container net-tools:
    first net interface:
        - bridge to net1
        - IP: 192.168.1.8/24
    second net interface:
        - bridge to net2
        - IP: 192.168.7.3/24

The OpenVPN client will contact the OpenVPN server IP address 192.168.1.5.
After the tunnel is established, the aquired tap-Interface is bridged to br0, in which
net2 of the local router already has been inserted.

As a test you can ping the IP address of the opposite
routers net2 (192.168.7.1 and 192.168.7.4).

For debugging watch /var/log/openvpn/current (e.g. with "cat <file>" or "tail -f <file>").
